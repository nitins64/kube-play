- vCluster
-- Main sync loop in vcluster/pkg/syncer/syncer.go
--- Function: func (r *SyncController) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, origReq ctrl.Request) (_ ctrl.Result, retErr error) {

----- Each resource has its own syncer Pod: (vcluster/pkg/controllers/resources/pods/syncer.go)

Reconcile function is called for each resource in the vCluster. It internally calls the syncer for the resource.


vcluster/pkg/syncer/syncer.go is implemented as a controller-runtime controller. (https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/references/client/)
It watches the vCluster resource and calls the Reconcile function for each vCluster resource.

vcluster/pkg/controllers/register.go registers the vCluster controller (syncer) with the manager.
